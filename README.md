# CSC365-Project
Project A for CSC365

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the "build_and_run.sh" script, i.e. ./build_and_run.sh
3. Program should run in the terminal


Before building, you must provide a file called ServerSettings.txt

If you were connecting to the mySQL server as user ‘‘scott’’ whose password is ‘‘tiger’’, then the contents of the ServerSettings.txt file would be

```
jdbc:mysql://ambari-head.csc.calpoly.edu/scott
scott
tiger
```
